# Predicting-Customer-Category-From-Personal-Information-Using-K-Nearest-Neighbours
This lab was a part of the IBM Professional Certificate in Data Science. The purpose of the lab was to predict a customer's category (type of service they would most want) given their personal information such as region, tenure, age, address, income etc. for a telecommunications company. The modelling and prediction was done using the K Nearest Neighbours method. The dataset was pulled from the company website, the data was split into training and testing sets, and then the best k value was determined based on model accuracy (k=9).
